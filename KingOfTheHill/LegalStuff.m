    return @{LegalKey : @"Terms of Service \n These Terms of Service (Terms) govern your access to and use of Alpha, including any Alpha mobile applications and websites (the Services), and any videos, information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as Content). Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.\n1. Basic Terms \n\nYou are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any consequences thereof. The Content you submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed by other users of the Services and through third party services and websites. You should only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.\n\nYou may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Alpha and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.\n\nThe Services that Alpha provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services that Alpha provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Alpha may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.\n\nThe Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the Content or information on the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by Alpha on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for Alpha granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Alpha and its parent, third party providers and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.\n\n2. Privacy\n\nAny information that you provide to Alpha is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Alpha. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Alpha account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.\n\n3. Passwords\n\nYou are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your account. We encourage you to use strong passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account and with other accounts that you may connect to your Alpha account (such as Twitter or your email). Alpha cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.\n\n4. Content on the Services\n\nAll Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. We may, but are not required to monitor or control the Content posted via the Services and we cannot take responsibility for such Content. Any use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk.\n\nWe do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Alpha be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere.\n\n5. Your Rights\n\nYou retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. In order to make the Services available to you and other users, Alpha needs a license from you. By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).\n\nYou agree that this license includes the right for Alpha to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Alpha for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by Alpha, or other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Alpha, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services.\n\nWe may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.\n\nYou are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you provide, and for any consequences thereof, including the use of your Content by other users and our third party partners. You understand that your Content may be syndicated, broadcasted, distributed, or published by our partners and if you do not have the right to submit Content for such use, it may subject you to liability for said content. Alpha will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content by Alpha in accordance with these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content that you submit.\n\n6. Your License to Use the Services\n\nAlpha gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software that is provided to you by Alpha as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Alpha, in the manner permitted by these Terms.\n\n7. Alpha Rights\n\nAll right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the exclusive property of Alpha and its licensors. The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Alpha reserves all rights not expressly granted in these Terms. You acknowledge and agree that any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding Alpha, or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.\n\n8. Restrictions on Content and Use of the Services\n\nWe reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, to suspend or terminate users, and to reclaim usernames and profile URLs without liability to you.\n\nWe also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (1) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (2) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (3) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (4) respond to user support requests, or (5) protect the rights, property or safety of Alpha, its users and the public. Alpha does not disclose personally identifying information to third parties except in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\n\nYou may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (1) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, Alpha's computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Alpha's providers; (2) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (3) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Alpha (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Alpha (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior consent of Alpha is expressly prohibited); (4) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (5) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.\n\n9. Copyright Policy\n\nAlpha respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the same. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us. If you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: (1) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (2) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (3) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (4) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address; (5) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (6) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n\nWe reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, Alpha will also terminate a users account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.\n\n10. Ending These Terms\n\nThe Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Alpha as follows.\n\nYou may end your legal agreement with Alpha at any time for any reason by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services.\n\nWe may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (1) you have violated these Terms, (2) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (3) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or through the Services the next time you attempt to access your account.\n\nIn all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.\n\nNothing in this section shall affect Alphas rights to change, limit or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as provided above in section 1.\n\n11. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability\n\nPlease read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Alpha and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the Alpha Entities). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.\n\nA. The Services are Available as is\n\nYour access to and use of the Services or any Content is at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an AS IS and AS AVAILABLE basis. Without limiting the foregoing, ALPHA ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\nAlpha Entities make no warranty and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (1) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services or any Content; 2. any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services, or any Content; 3. the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any Content and other communications maintained by the Services; (4) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Alpha Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.\n\nB. Links\n\nThe Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for: (1) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (2) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by Alpha Entities of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.\n\nC. Limitation of Liability\n\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE ALPHA ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (1) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (2) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (3) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (4) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.\n\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE ALPHA ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID ALPHA, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.\n\nTHE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE ALPHA ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n\n12. General Terms\n\nA. Waiver and Severability\n\nThe failure of Alpha to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.\n B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction\nThese Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).\n\nC. Entire Agreement\n\nThese Terms, the Privacy Policy is the entire and exclusive agreement between Alpha and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Alpha that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Alpha and you regarding the Services.\n\nAny concerns feel free to shoot us an email at:  alphaapp.123@gmail.com\n\nHave Fun!\n\n\n\nAlpha Privacy Policy\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes how and when Alpha collects, uses, and shares your information when you use Alpha, including our mobile applications and websites (the Services). Alpha receives your information through our mobile applications, websites, email notifications, and other interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Alpha to use your information in the United States and any other country where Alpha operates.\n\nInformation Collection and Use\n\nCreating a Alpha Account and Profile Information: When you create a Alpha account, you must provide access credentials in the form of an email address and password. You may optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a short bio, location, and profile picture. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time. Profile information is available publicly on our Services, such as on your profile page.\n\nContact Information: In addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may use this information to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and facilitate your use of the Services. We may use the contact information (such as your phone number or email address) to help connect you with other Alpha users, even if that information is not publicly displayed.\n\nContent, Following, and other Public Information: Alpha is a video sharing platform, so most of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you follow, the Content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your profile information and public Content are immediately delivered to a wide range of users and other services that access Alpha. When you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.\n\nLocation Information: In addition to profile information, you may also tell us your exact location if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as tagging a video with a location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with Content that has been tagged near your location.\n\nLog Data: Our servers automatically record information (Log Data) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services,view videos hosted by Alpha, or interact with our email notifications. Alpha uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.\n\nThird-Party Services: Alpha uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, including to host our various blogs and wikis and to help us understand the use of our Services. These third-party service providers may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and services, including your IP address, device ID, pages viewed, and links clicked. Our service providers include Google Analytics and its demographics and interests reporting feature, which you can opt out of here and here.\n\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\n\nYour Consent: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you choose to publicly post a video or update your profile information.\n\nService Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.\n\nLaw and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Alphas rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's, including a government's, request to disclose your information.\n\nBusiness Transfers: In the event that Alpha is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.\n\nNon-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public posts, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).\n\nModifying Your Personal Information\n\nIf you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the profile information you provided to us and associated with your account.\n\nYou can also permanently delete your Alpha account by contacting us through email at alphaapp.123@gmail.com .\n\nOur Policy Towards Children\n\nOur Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at alphaapp.123@gmail.com . We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the childs account.\n\nChanges to this Policy\n\nWe may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at this web address. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an email to the email address associated with your account or through the Services. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.\n"
